        This extension previously had a cursor issue with leetcode&apos; editor, which I&apos;ve
        attempted to fix in this version. However, if you notice that the fonts are not changing
        properly or encounter any other bugs, please leave a review on

        I was inspired by the fonts presented in this list
        <Link url="https://hail2u.github.io/mn" label="https://hail2u.github.io/mn" /> to set them
        as default ones
      </p>

        <code>{"<TODO/> : "}</code>
        If I get some free time, I was thinking of adding support for the{" "}
        <Link className="ml-0" url="https://fonts.google.com" label="Google Fonts API" /> to
        dynamically load any font from their site. That way, you wouldn&apos;t be limited to just
        the default options. But to be honest, it feels like a bit of overengineering â€” the default
        fonts already get the job done well enough.
